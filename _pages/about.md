Welcome to my website! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Management Science / Operations Management at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Iâ€™m advised by [Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). Previously, I received a B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from UC Berkeley.


Research Interests
------------------
My current research focus is on queueing theory and computational methods for solving high-dimensional stochastic control problems.
