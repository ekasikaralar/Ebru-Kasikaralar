Welcome! I'm a Research Scientist at Amazon's Worldwide Capacity Planning. Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [The University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/), where I was advised by Professor [Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from [UC Berkeley College of Engineering](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/).
