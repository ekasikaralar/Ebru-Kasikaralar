Advances in storing and processing big data have transformed how digital platforms learn about product quality and user preferences. Since collecting and using data is essential in generating successful matching algorithms and enhancing customers' purchase experience, companies heavily rely on consumer data to make pricing decisions. On the one hand, due to increased data privacy concerns, policies restricting firms' access to consumers' data are expected to become more prevalent. On the other hand, restricting the firms' access to consumer data negatively affects not only the firms but also the consumers since personalization is lost. Instead, considering giving ownership to the consumers of their data would give them control over how their data is used and collected. Consequently, with the consumers' full ownership of their data, we introduce a model where the myopic consumers and a monopolistic firm directly interact in two different markets: product and data markets. There is a costly dynamic data exchange between the firm and the consumers, where the firm offers incentives to buyers to sell their data. The firm uses acquired data from consumers to learn the underlying product quality, and consumers use the acquired data from the firm to make strategic purchase decisions.
